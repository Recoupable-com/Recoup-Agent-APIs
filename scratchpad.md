### Current Task: Implement /api/posts Endpoint (Step 43)

#### Task Description

According to the ROADMAP.md file (step 43), we need to implement a new API endpoint:

```
43. [] P1: /api/posts - new API endpoint
    actual:
    The /api/posts endpoint is currently missing.
    required:
    Implement the /api/posts endpoint to follow the newly deployed docs available at https://chat.recoupable.com/docs/posts. This endpoint should accept the artist_account_id parameter and return an array of posts (Post[]) from Supabase, covering all posts from the artist across all social platforms.
```

#### Implementation Plan

1. [ ] **Understand the Requirements**:
   - [ ] Review the API documentation at https://chat.recoupable.com/docs/posts
   - [ ] Identify the expected request parameters and response format
   - [ ] Understand the data model for posts in Supabase

2. [ ] **Explore Existing Code**:
   - [ ] Examine similar API endpoints for patterns and best practices
   - [ ] Look for existing Supabase query functions that might be reusable
   - [ ] Check the database schema for posts and related tables

3. [ ] **Create Database Query Function**:
   - [ ] Implement a function to query posts from Supabase
   - [ ] Ensure it filters by artist_account_id
   - [ ] Include posts from all social platforms
   - [ ] Handle pagination if needed

4. [ ] **Implement API Endpoint**:
   - [ ] Create a new route handler for /api/posts
   - [ ] Add parameter validation
   - [ ] Connect to the database query function
   - [ ] Format the response according to the API docs

5. [ ] **Test the Implementation**:
   - [ ] Test with valid artist_account_id
   - [ ] Test with invalid parameters
   - [ ] Verify response format matches the documentation
   - [ ] Check performance with large datasets

#### Next Steps

1. [ ] Review the API documentation to understand the exact requirements
2. [ ] Explore the existing codebase for similar patterns and reusable components
3. [ ] Implement the database query function
4. [ ] Create the API endpoint handler
5. [ ] Test the implementation thoroughly
